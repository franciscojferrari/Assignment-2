""" This file is created as a template for question 2.4 in DD2434 - Assignment 2.

    We encourage you to keep the function templates as is.
    However this is not a "must" and you can code however you like.
    You can write helper functions however you want.

    You do not have to implement the code for finding a maximum spanning tree from scratch. We provided two different
    implementations of Kruskal's algorithm and modified them to return maximum spanning trees as well as the minimum
    spanning trees. However, it will be beneficial for you to try and implement it. You can also use another
    implementation of maximum spanning tree algorithm, just do not forget to reference the source (both in your code
    and in your report)! Previously, other students used NetworkX package to work with trees and graphs, keep in mind.

    We also provided an example regarding the Robinson-Foulds metric (see Phylogeny.py).

    If you want, you can use the class structures provided to you (Node, Tree and TreeMixture classes in Tree.py file),
    and modify them as needed. In addition to the sample files given to you, it is very important for you to test your
    algorithm with your own simulated data for various cases and analyse the results.

    For those who do not want to use the provided structures, we also saved the properties of trees in .txt and .npy
    format.

    Note that the sample files are tab delimited with binary values (0 or 1) in it.
    Each row corresponds to a different sample, ranging from 0, ..., N-1
    and each column corresponds to a vertex from 0, ..., V-1 where vertex 0 is the root.
    Example file format (with 5 samples and 4 nodes):
    1   0   1   0
    1   0   1   0
    1   0   0   0
    0   0   1   1
    0   0   1   1

    Also, I am aware that the file names and their extensions are not well-formed, especially in Tree.py file
    (i.e example_tree_mixture.pkl_samples.txt). I wanted to keep the template codes as simple as possible.
    You can change the file names however you want (i.e tmm_1_samples.txt).

    For this assignment, we gave you a single tree mixture (q2_4_tree_mixture).
    The mixture has 3 clusters, 5 nodes and 100 samples.
    We want you to run your EM algorithm and compare the real and inferred results
    in terms of Robinson-Foulds metric and the likelihoods.
